One of the simplest methods for memory allocation is to divide memory into several fixed-sized partitions. Each partition may contain exactly one process. In this multiple-partition method, when a partition is free, a process is selected from the input queue and is loaded into the free partition. When the process terminates, the partition becomes available for another process. The operating system keeps a table indicating which parts of memory are available and which are occupied. Finally, when a process arrives and needs memory, a memory section large enough for this process is provided. When it is time to load or swap a process into main memory, and if there is more than one free block of memory of sufficient size, then the operating system must decide which free block to allocate. Best-fit strategy chooses the block that is closest in size to the request. First-fit chooses the first available block that is large enough. Worst-fit chooses the largest available block.
